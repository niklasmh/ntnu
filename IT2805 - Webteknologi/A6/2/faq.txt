DigiCam
-------

Q: What is the difference between optical and digital zoom?

A: With optical zoom, the Digicam's lens physically moves inside the camera; with
digital zoom, the camera's processor zooms the image electronically. If you zoom
too much, your image will become pixelated.

lifetime. Nickel-cadium batteries also work very well, as do alkaline batteries.
Do not use lithium batteries.

A: We recommend 640×480 for 4×6-inch images, 1024×768 for 5×7-inch photos, and
1600×1200 for 8×10-inch photos.

Q: Can the DigiCam be harmed by airport X-ray machines?

A: No, there is no evidence that X-ray machines can affect the performance of the
DigiCam or the quality of DigiCam photos.
